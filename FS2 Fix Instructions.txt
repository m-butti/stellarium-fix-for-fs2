FS2 does not like the # prefixed to an instruction
Also a movement stop when it's not moving gets stored and executed the next time a movement is initiated. Therefore we have to remove any prefix stop commands to a move instruction.

Bonus: It can be confusing, when Stellarium starts to fullscreen. It can be turned off (fullscreen = false) in "Stellarium\data\default_cfg.ini"
