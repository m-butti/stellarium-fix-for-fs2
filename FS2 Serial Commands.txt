The degree symbol depicted as an * is actually an ÃŸ (ASCII: 223 Hex: DF)

### General Telescope Information ###

:GR#
    Returns +HH:MM.T#
        Gets the current Right Ascension.
	A Mapug-Astronomy post indicated that for the 3.34L ROMS the format is  +HH:MM:SS# for RA
	And the format for Declination is  sDD*MM'SS#.  Thus adding seconds and arc seconds.

:GD#
    Returns sDD*MM#
        Gets the current declination.

### Telescope Motion ###

:Mn#
:Ms#
:Me#
:Mw#
    Returns Nothing
        Starts motion in the specified direction at the current rate.

:MS#
    Returns 0, 1, or 2 (see description)
        Slews telescope to current object coordinates. 0 is returned if the telescope can complete the slew,
        1 is returned if the object is below the horizon, and 2 is returned if the object is below the 'higher'
        limit. If 1 or 2 is returned, a string containing an appropriate message is also returned.

:Qn#
:Qs#
:Qe#
:Qw#
    Returns Nothing
        Stops motion in the specified direction. Also stops the telescope if a slew to object is in progress.

:Q#
    Returns Nothing
        Stops a slew to an object.

:RG#
:RC#
:RM#
:RS#
    Returns Nothing
        Sets the motion rate to guide (RG), center (RC), find (RM), or slew (RS).

### Library/Objects ###

:Sr HH:MM.T#
    Returns Ok
        Sets object Right Ascension.

:Sd sDD*MM#
    Returns Ok
        Sets object Declination.

:CM#
    Returns (see description)
        Sync. Matches current telescope coordinates to the object coordinates and sends a string indicating which
        object's coordinates were used.

:U#
    Returns Nothing
        Toggles the long format ON or OFF.
            When the long format is active, whenever a request to send or receive position data, the following format is used:
	HH:MM:SS
	Example: 05:47:45
	Range: 00:00.0 to 23:59:59
	Hours, minutes, and seconds.
	sDD*MM:SS
	Example: +45*59:45
	Range: -90*00 to +90*00
	Signed degrees, minutes, and seconds (the'*' represents ASCII 223 which appears on
	the handbox as a degree symbol).
	DDD*MM:SS
	Example: 254*09:45
	Range: 000*00 to 359*59:59
	Unsigned degrees, minutes, and seconds.
